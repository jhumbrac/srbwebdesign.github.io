				Of course we want to showcase the iconic Sydney attractions but also delve further and expose those lesser known locales. Our tours take you deep into the city centre, its incredible coastline and national parks.</p>

				<p>Australia is not just about its vistas. It has a relatively short history but one full of interest. We want to share its Aboriginal heritage, early European beginnings and the multicultural nation that it is today.</p>

					<h2>Sydney City sights and Bondi Beach Tour</h2>
					<h3>Half Day Tour</h3>
					<p>This is a half day that maximises time and highlights Sydney’s iconic and picturesque locations.</p>
					<p>After city hotel pick up, we journey straight to where Australia’s colonial history began and get some photo opportunities around the harbour.</p>
					<p>We then venture to the Botanical Gardens, Lady Macquarie’s Chair and the ever-evolving suburbs of Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross. Following the harbour, we journey through the city’s eastern bays out to south head.  We are then off to iconic Bondi Beach and return to the city via fashionable Oxford Street, Paddington.</p>
					<p>Guests are picked up from their city hotel at 8am and returned at 12 midday or picked up at 1pm and returned at 5pm. (Guests have options regarding return if an alternative drop off is possible.)</p>
