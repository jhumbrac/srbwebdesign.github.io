		<p>Discover the great attractions and hidden gems of Sydney and its surrounds</p>
		<p>The city of Sydney exudes a vibrancy, diversity and openness that begs the international traveller to embrace its unique offerings and majestic panoramas.</p>
		<p>Sydney Scenic Private Tours offer a range of group itineraries which can be customised to create the best possible experience for each individual group. Of course we want to showcase the iconic Sydney attractions but also delve further and expose those lesser known locales. Our tours take you deep into the city centre, its incredible coastline and national parks.</p>
		<p>Australia is not just about its vistas. It has a relatively short history but one full of interest. We want to share its Aboriginal heritage, early European beginnings and the multicultural nation that it is today.</p>
		<p>Our pricing structure aims to provide superior value for groups of 4-24 passengers. We are proud of our client-based approach and commitment to ensuring your memories of Sydney will be full of joy and last a lifetime.</p>
		<p>So letâ€™s get out there and experience one of the great modern cities of the world.</p>
